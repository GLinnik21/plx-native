# PlxNative Privacy Policy

Applies to PlxNative 0.5.0. Last updated 1 September 2026.

## Who is responsible for PlxNative data

Gleb Linnik is responsible only for data PlxNative stores locally and for optional reports you
choose to share. Contact: `glinnik21@gmail.com`.

## Plex services

PlxNative is an independent client for Plex. To sign you in, discover servers and provide Plex
account features, the app communicates directly with Plex services. Plex processes information
received by those services under [Plex’s own Privacy
Policy](https://www.plex.tv/about/privacy-legal/). PlxNative’s developer does not receive that
information.

## Plex Media Servers

To browse and play media, update watch progress and use server features, PlxNative communicates
directly with the Plex Media Servers you select. Those requests are handled by the selected server
and its operator. PlxNative’s developer does not receive them.

## Data stored on this television

PlxNative stores the session needed to sign in, the selected profile, Home library choices,
playback position, settings and a small rotating local log. It may temporarily store optional
reports waiting to be sent. The Settings screen can sign out and remove PlxNative data from this
television.

## Optional crash reports

Crash reporting is off until you choose to share it. If enabled, PlxNative sends technical crash
details to Sentry in Germany. A report may include the signal, code addresses, thread information,
internal component labels, app and webOS versions, television model and hardware compatibility
details needed to reproduce and symbolicate the failure. Crash reports do not use the product
analytics identifier.

The same independent choice also covers a handled playback-error report when playback reaches its
explicit terminal error screen. That report contains a fixed failure kind, delivery and quality
classes, coarse raster, rate, HTTP and buffer classes, whether a first picture appeared, and at
most 32 typed playback transitions with bucketed elapsed times. It contains no title, ratingKey,
URL, path, playhead, duration, exact bitrate, server identity, address, token, account or profile,
and is not joined to the product analytics identifier or `playback_id`. Buffering, seeking, holding
a low quality, or rejecting an adaptive-bitrate candidate does not by itself send a report.
The closed diagnostic vocabulary includes terminal kinds such as `playback_interrupted` and
`original_rollback`; HLS direction `refresh`; delivery reason `original_open_rollback`; and
Original-check outcomes `started`, `succeeded`, `no_body`, `deadline`, `transport`,
`inconclusive`, `server_state` and `refused`.

## Optional product analytics

Product analytics is a separate choice and is off until you choose to share it. If enabled,
PlxNative sends typed screen and feature events and broad sign-in and playback outcome classes to
PostHog in Germany. Reports use a random installation identifier and may include the app version,
webOS version, television model and SoC, and whether the selected server is local, remote or
relayed. Turning product analytics off deletes the local identifier; enabling it later creates a
new one.

The Settings screen shows field-by-field example payloads produced through the same serializers
used for real reports.

Every product analytics event also carries this bounded compatibility and connection context:

| `playback.abandoned` | `playback_id` — a random number minted per attempt, never stored and never reused; `mode` — `direct` or `transcode` |
| `playback.quality` | `playback_id` — a random number minted per attempt, never stored and never reused; `rebuffers` — `0` / `1` / `2-3` / `4+`; `buffering` — `none` / `<2s` / `2-10s` / `10s+` — never the interval |
| `playback.ended` | `playback_id` — a random number minted per attempt, never stored and never reused; `mode` — `direct` or `transcode`; `watched` — `abandoned` / `some` / `most` / `finished` — never a position or a duration |

## Never included in optional reports

Optional reports have no fields for media titles, Plex accounts or profile names, searches, server
names or addresses, access tokens, subtitle text, or exact viewing history.

## Your choices

Crash reports and product analytics are independent. You can enable either, both or neither during
setup, and change either choice later in Settings → Privacy & data. Withdrawing a choice stops new
reports of that category and removes queued records that are no longer permitted.

## Contact and non-affiliation

Privacy questions may be sent to `glinnik21@gmail.com`. Security vulnerabilities may be reported
privately through GitHub Security Advisories for `GLinnik21/plx-native`.
